The goal is to be the first team to visit all of the lighthouses during the challenge weekend.  An EP [professor and his wife](https://www.facebook.com/cheslights/photos/a.2861267277221280/2995180270496646/?type=1&theater) have [competed very favorably](https://cheslights.org/1st-finishers-results-2019-md-lighthouse-challenge/) in this event ;-)  \n",

This two-part problem will have you explore different strategies for identifying the fastest *tour*&mdash;the path and starting point that leads contestants to visit all lighthouses finishing at the earliest possible time, with algorithms that run in a reasonable amount of wall-clock time.\n",

        "## Constraints\n",
        "The implementation is not collaborative.  While writing the algorithm may be a collaborative effort as indicated in one of the homework assignments, you must write your own code following the Programming Assignment Guidelines (Blackboard page Syllabus & Course Information ).  Pay careful attention to the academic integrity requirements regarding publicly available code.\n",

        "Use the function signatures and any data structures as supplied&mdash;do not change function signatures or introduce strange calling conventions; the instructor's tests are written assuming these function signatures.  Further, beware of strange *side effects* that may cause bad behavior on subsequent runs of the code.  Be sure to \"restart and run all\" prior to submitting your notebook, as the instructor will do the same when testing.  Points will be deducted if the instructor has to make any changes in order to run your code.\n",

        "The analysis and graphs must be driven with programmatically derived data, not \"hard coded\" or pasted in run counts.  An example of what **not** to do: xvals=[3, 4, 12, 15, 36, 47] /* hard coded */  Instead, xvals = [i for i in mycounts] where mycounts is an array updated through various trials you perform using your function(s).\n",
        "\n",
        "As for notebook runtimes, the notebook must never exceed an execution time of FIVE WALL-CLOCK MINUTES.  If your notebook does not execute on a cloud service, such as Google Colaboratory, on the supplied instructor inputs within this time, points will be deducted.  It likely means there's a bug in your implementation.  If you have issues with this, reach out to your instructor."
