        "Commenting and other programming do not's:\n",
        " * Do not write a dissertation in the comments.  Top blocks usually require 2, 3 sentences; inline (with code) comments are usually one line.\n",
        " * Do not \"translate\" your code into English.  Assume I can read code.  Do *not* assume that I understand:<br> ``y = {n:max([d for d in range(1,10) if n % d == 0]) for n in nums}``\n",
