        "## Closest Points\n",
        "\n",
        "Given the task of finding the closest pair of points in a two-dimensional plane, students were tasked with implementing a brute force algorithm, but making at least one change to improve its runtime down from $\\Theta(n^2)$.  Usually, brute force iterates over all pairs of points by way of a doubly nested ``for`` loop.  They were also asked to implement the closest points divide-and-conquer approach in the CLRS textbook that has a runtime of $O(n\\log n)$.\n",
        "\n",
        "To improve the brute force method, one clever student had the idea to sort the list of points beforehand by x value.  When processing point i, and in the loop that pairs i with all other points j, if the x difference between i and j is greater than the current minimum distance, then stop processing j and subsequent points.  Instead, *skip ahead* to the next i.  In this way, since all points following j have a greater x value, there is no need to consider them.\n",
        "\n",
        "Students were directed to do testing against random points in a list of increasing size, from 3 to N points, and plotting/comparing brute force skip-ahead performance against divide-and-conquer.\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Paradox\n",
        "The submission in question did such a comparison, but the plot showed very similar asymptotic performance to CLRS.  It seemed that no matter how the points were randomized, the skip-ahead program always performed about the same as the divide-and-conquer.  This seemed crazy; we are always taught that $n\\log n$ beats $n^2$, so why is the plot telling us otherwise?  Also, the plot seemed unstable - repeated trials showed near equal performance to divide-and-conquer, but sometimes the performance spiked a little bit high.  What is going on here? \n",

        "# Instructions to Students\n",
        "This is **not** an assignment that you need to turn in.  Instead, it is a tool to explore the phenomena, and help you with a homework problem.  The brute force implementation is given; if you prefer, you may paste in your CLRS implementation to experiment on similar sets of points, but you don't need to."
