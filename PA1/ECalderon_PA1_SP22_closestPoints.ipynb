        "Implement two algorithms to return the closest pair of points in a Euclidean two-dimensional plane.  The first algorithm shall be a brute-force approach, with improvements, that runs no worse than $\\theta(n^2)$ time, and the second algorithm will be a recursive divide-and-conquer method that runs in $O(n\\log(n))$ time.  You'll kick the tires on both of these and analyze runtime performance and improvements.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Tasks\n",
        "Specifically, you must:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Write the algorithms, in correct pseudocode notation.  [This part may have been assigned on a previous or concurrent homework assignment.]\n",
        "1. Implement both algorithms correctly, in this notebook. \n",
        "1. Compare/contrast algorithm performance via graphs.  In this one case, the performance is related to the number of calls to the distance method.\n",
        "1. Discuss your experiences and opportunities to improve.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Requirements\n",
        "On the first algorithm, you must implement a brute-force method with *at least one improvement* over a very simple method.  The baseline is \"for i in all points, for j in all points, call the distance function, yada yada\" and you shall improve on that in at least one *asymptotically similar* way by cutting down the number of calls to the distance function.  More on that in the section down below.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the second algorithm, you must implement it as the CLRS book describes in section 33.4 (and as you have fleshed out in the full realization of this algorithm; CLRS provides only a sketch).\n",
        "\n",
        "You will plot a curve that shows the improvement of the second approach over the first.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Constraints\n",
        "\n",
        "The implementation is not collaborative.  While writing the algorithm may be a collaborative effort as indicated in one of the homework assignments, you must write your own code following the Programming Assignment Guidelines (Blackboard page Syllabus & Course Information ).  Pay careful attention to the academic integrity requirements regarding publicly available code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Use the function signatures and any data structures as supplied$-$do not change function signatures or introduce strange calling conventions; the instructor's tests are written assuming these function signatures.  Further, beware of strange *side effects* that may cause bad behavior on subsequent runs of the code.  Be sure to \"restart and run all\" prior to submitting your notebook, as the instructor will do the same when testing.  Points will be deducted if the instructor has to make any changes in order to run your code.\n",
        "\n",
        "The analysis and graphs must be driven with programmatically derived data, not \"hard coded\" or pasted in run counts.  An example of what **not** to do: xvals=[3, 4, 12, 15, 36, 47] /* hard coded */  Instead, xvals = [i for i in mycounts] where mycounts is an array updated through various trials you perform using your function(s).\n",
        "\n",
        "As for notebook runtimes, the notebook must never exceed an execution time of FIVE WALL-CLOCK MINUTES.  If your notebook does not execute on a cloud service, such as Google Colaboratory, on the supplied instructor inputs within this time, points will be deducted.  It likely means there's a bug in your implementation.  If you have issues with this, reach out to your instructor."
